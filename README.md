Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries
Objective:
Practice using scalar, correlated, and nested subqueries in different SQL clauses — SELECT, WHERE, and FROM.

Tools:

MySQL Workbench (for MySQL users)
github

Deliverables:

SQL script file (task6.sql) containing at least 6 subquery.

Hints / Mini Guide:

Scalar Subqueries – Returns a single value, can be used in SELECT or WHERE.

Correlated Subqueries – Uses a reference to an outer query column.

Subqueries with IN, EXISTS, or = – To filter based on another query result.

Subqueries in FROM – Treat subquery results as a virtual table.

Expected Outcome:
Gain the ability to write complex queries that pull data indirectly using subqueries — useful for analytics and performance tuning.
